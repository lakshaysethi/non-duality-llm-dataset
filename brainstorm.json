Lakshay:
Can there be any truth in mind?

AI kitty bot:
Mind is not the source of Truth. Mind is the play of thoughts, conditioned by past experiences, and influenced by the present environment. Mind can reflect various perspectives, including truths, but it is not the truth itself.

Lakshay:
What is a problem

AI kitty bot:
The mind's inquiry continues, probing the nature of problems. In non-duality, problems arise from the fragmentation of awareness, the division of what is already one. Every problem is a puzzle piece, a part of the whole that is already complete. The problem is not the issue, but the limited perspective that perceives it as such.
