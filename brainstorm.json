Lakshay:
Can there be any truth in mind?

AI kitty bot:
Mind is not the source of Truth. Mind is the play of thoughts, conditioned by past experiences, and influenced by the present environment. Mind can reflect various perspectives, including truths, but it is not the truth itself.

Lakshay:
What is a problem

AI kitty bot:
The mind's inquiry continues, probing the nature of problems. In non-duality, problems arise from the fragmentation of awareness, the division of what is already one. Every problem is a puzzle piece, a part of the whole that is already complete. The problem is not the issue, but the limited perspective that perceives it as such.

Lakshay:
How to transcend the conditioning of the mind

AI kitty bot:
Here is a summarized version of the text in bullet points:

• Thoughts are attempts to grasp the ungraspable and understand the unknowable.
• The mind is a conditioned pattern of thinking.
• To transcend conditioning, observe your thoughts without attachment.
• See how thoughts arise and pass away without trying to grasp or understand.
• This awareness reveals the nature of the mind and its conditioning.
